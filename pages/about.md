<u>About Me</u>
===============

Hi, I'm **{{ site.author.name }}**.<br>
A Games Designer and Developer studying at University in Southampton.

I love videogames and the interactive medium it brings to the world which allows us to engage in deeper ways. I enjoy learning and interacting with new things and I have a wide array of interests from making music and 3D art/animation to programming and writing.

Games design and Games Programming are areas that have always interested me and I've been doing them since the age of 17. The creativity of coming up with various ideas and understanding how to make them work for a user from an analytical and problem solving side is an incredibly fun challenge. Then, going on to implement them and see them come to life and provide enjoyment to people is an indescribable experience which I take great pride in seeing.

Other than that? I spend my free time playing games and helping others online.
